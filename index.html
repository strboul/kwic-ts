As the use of typewriters grew in the late 19th century, the phrase began appearing in typing lesson books as a practice sentence. Early examples include How to Become Expert in Typewriting: A Complete Instructor Designed Especially for the Remington Typewriter (1890),[5] and Typewriting Instructor and Stenographer&#x27;s Hand-book (1892). By the turn of the 20th century, the phrase had become widely known. In the January 10, 1903, issue of Pitman&#x27;s Phonetic Journal, it is referred to as &quot;the well known memorized typing line embracing all the letters of the alphabet&quot;.[6] Robert Baden-Powell&#x27;s book Scouting for Boys (1908) uses the phrase as a practice sentence for signaling.[1]
